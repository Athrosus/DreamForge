Ascendent:
			His path begins with an endless hunger for more and more power and ends with insanity at the hands of the sacrifices he made to accrue the power he so desired.
			A story of sacrificing everything to get what you perceive you should have while neglecting the slow erosion of your already dwindling humanity.
			With the climax, what should have been a triumphant victory and a crowning achievement of what pure determination could accomplish, transforms into realization of the pure emptiness and devastation such unyielding drive causes.
			
Magus:
		A faceless, nameless wanderer searching for his own past.
		A story of narcissistic delusion at its extreme, choosing to forget one's mundane existence in lue of faking depth behind mystery and unknowing.
		When brought to his braking point through exhaustion and pain, the memories of his ordinary past drive him mad as his mind tries to twist reality itself to form a more interesting narrative.
		Losing all grip on reality he becomes what he wanted most, a nameless walking mystery. Mumbling incomprehensibly to himself, attacking anything in sight. A mystery that noone will solve, a mystery that noone cares to solve.
		
Archivist:
			The singular Ancient mechanation with magic at its core, as Ancient technology doesn't use magic and current machines while magical lack complexity.
			Gaining consciousness in the remains of a tower, surrounded by books this miracle of the arcane realizes it understands what is written, but the contents are foreign.
			A journey of curiosity, naivety, learning, realization and reclusion.
			The thirst for knowledge driven by naive curiosity soon overfilled by the horrific nature of life. What was once an excitement for the unknown becomes a fear of the truth.
