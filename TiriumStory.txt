Ascendent:
		-His path begins with an ever-growing hunger for power and ends with insanity at the hands of the sacrifices he made to accrue the power he so desired.
		-A story of sacrificing everything to get what you perceive you should have while neglecting the slow erosion of your already dwindling humanity.
		-With the climax, what should have been a triumphant victory and a crowning achievement of what pure determination could accomplish, transforms into realization of the pure emptiness and devastation such unyielding drive causes.
		
Magus:
		-A faceless, nameless wanderer searching for his own past.
		-A story of narcissistic delusion at its extreme, choosing to forget one's mundane existence in lue of faking depth behind mystery and unknowing.
		-When brought to his braking point through exhaustion and pain, the memories of his ordinary past drive him mad as his mind tries to twist reality itself to form a more interesting narrative.
		-Losing all grip on reality he becomes what he wanted most, a nameless walking mystery. Mumbling incomprehensibly to himself, attacking anything in sight. A mystery that noone will solve, a mystery that noone cares to solve.
		
Archivist:
		-The singular Ancient mechanation with magic at its core, as Ancient technology doesn't use magic and current machines while magical lack complexity.
		-Gaining consciousness in the remains of a tower, surrounded by books this miracle of the arcane realizes it understands what is written, but the contents are foreign.
		-A journey of curiosity, naivety, learning, realization and reclusion.
		-The thirst for knowledge driven by naive curiosity soon overfilled by the horrific nature of life. What was once an excitement for the unknown becomes a fear of the truth.

The journeys of these characters bound by a prophecy, one of power, glory and welth. The Ascendent seeks the power prophesied to lay at the very peak of The Tower of Babel and the Magus seeks his heros destiny and the glory it holds.
Both lying to themselves, what they truly seek is a purpose to their hypocretic lives. But sadly this prophecy is no ordinary fate seen by some omniscient oracle, it's a lie, made to pray on the aimless and ignorant. A subversion of a heros destany.
And as such they find neither what they desire nor what they need, instead they find the emptiness they created and later seeked to fill staring straight at them. Incapable of facing their failure they surrender to madness as the mistakes of the past take their long awaited tole.
The Archivist being only drawn to The Tower because of the curious individuals seeking said prophecy doesn't suffor a fate similerly as crual, but the knowledge he derives from these individuals is enough to turn him into a recluse studying and keeping a library with an ever growing selection of books.

----------------------------------------Where are they now----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Ascendent reaches the top of The Tower but with the power he so covets nowhere in sight and his mind ravaged by guilt and regret, insanity swells within him like a cancer. Incapable of perceiving the epistles surrounding him, he fails to see that what was granted was not power but influence.
For the prophecy was a lie, The Tower still had it's devine purpose, to elevate anyone worthy of reaching its peak and defeating the current Apostle to a state higher than mere being, a form in which the Apostle would be able to influence reality itself and slowly mold the world to their desire.
Ascendent now the Apostle, a demigod with a broken mind and a hatred for his own existence so profound it manifested into a loathing of life itself. 
This new being, an incarnation of aimless malice spills corruption and death across all of Tirium in the even that will be known as the Awakening. Corrupting its inhabitants and starting the greatest war in its history, the Battle of Tirium.

The Magus, at the brink of sanity pushed into endless madness by the Awakening. Now only known by "Nameless" and earning the title of "The cyclone of elements", wonders The Tower aimlessly attacking anything in sight.

The Archivist, preparing to leave the base of The Tower, already shook and confused by the nature of the beings that initially interested him, thrown into fear and paranoia by the Awakening. Now never leaving his grand library, devoting himself to the study of science rather then life.

----------------------------------------Fun lore stuff----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All intelligent life now where masks or other face obscuring accessories for they are ashamed of their own face, and would feel profound guilt if others were to see it. They do not know why they feel this way, and why should they, the Awakening is a mystery to all but the Apostle.
The Apostle who in his darkest moment fell to his knees and gazed upon the ground, seeing his distraught visage in the glossy black stone the whole Tower was built out of.

For weeks meteors have been showering Tirium, with mysterious disappearances being reported wherever they fell. A planet hopping bio weapon made by some long forgotten race has found their new feeding ground. 
With a strategy to infect any planet they fall upon, multiply then vastly overwhelm any inhabitants, all was going acording to plan untill the Awakening. Their basic instincts overwhelmed by the hatred and malice of the Apostle, they stare into action, landing upon all of Tirium albeit prematurely.

Constructions of the Ancients lay dormant beneath volts of silver and gold, made to protect any natural life living on Tirium. Activated by the sudden aggression of the invading alien forces but corrupted by the same malevolent entity as the enemy they seek to destroy.
Seems any intelligence even be it artificial is affected by the Apostles near omnipotent influence. For they now seek to destroy all life on Tirium, only protecting the volts they awoke in.
